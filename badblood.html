            <p>When Detective Kim Stone races to the crime scene, there is no body waiting for her: the paramedics are desperately trying to save the victim’s life. But there is something very strange about the way the man was found, his arms raised above his head, his legs spread apart. When he dies on the way to the hospital, Kim is certain she’s on the hunt for a killer… but all evidence at the scene has been destroyed.</p>
            <p>The dead man, Eric Gould, seems ordinary, until the team digs into his past. As a teenager, he was locked away for attacking his girlfriend, and Kim suspects he was hurting his fiancée now. Was someone trying to stop history repeating?</p>
            <p>Then another man is found on the verge of death, his bones broken to force him into an unnatural shape. The team realizes the killer is sending a message – the victims’ bodies are spelling out their sins. As boys, they were both part of a group of six who bragged about their terrible crimes. But they were children then, and when she sees the grief on the faces of their loved ones now, Kim swears to find answers.</p>
            <p>Is someone finally getting revenge… or do they think these men are still dangerous? The killer is threatening to strike again, and the only way Kim can crack the case is by tracking down the rest of the six first.</p>
            <p>But then a revelation about what one of her team is suffering makes Kim understand why people take the law into their own hands. Do these victims deserve what’s coming to them? Or is there even more to fear from their brutal killer?</p>
